## So,  you're probably wondering.. "Why Schife?"
While we embrace many traditions, the typical naming convention that comes with marriage just isn't one for us. We decided that we wanted a surname that truly shows a blending of our two family names. Allie's last name is Schauer - hence the "Sch" beginning our new name. Clint's last name is Campbell, but this is the last name that was given to his ancestors that immigrated to America. His ancestral family name was Fife - hence the "ife" ending our new name. As family is the most important thing to us, changing our last name to Schife is our way to honor our beloved family lines.
