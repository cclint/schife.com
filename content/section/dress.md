title: "Dress"

We can't emphasize enough that our wedding is about family and comfort. Dress code is casual ("PNW business casual" where we live), so think a nice blouse or Polo and jeans or slacks, or a simple dress. It's outside in the summer in Colorado: shorts are totally welcome, and we recommend that you bring a light jacket or something a little warm for after the sun goes down. Though it's unlikely to rain, it wouldn't hurt to bring a rain jacket in case there's an afternoon drizzle. There's absolutely no dress code for the camping before the wedding - though the best camping garb will get an "atta boy" from Clint.
