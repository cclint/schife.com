Dress code for our wedding will be PNW business casual (girls: a nice top and jeans or dress | boys: a polo/button up with jeans/slacks)! The day before the wedding, there will be no dress code! Bring your best camping outfit. Winner gets an "atta boy".

As we will be getting married in Colorado during the summer **we encourage everyone to dress cool**! It also wouldn't hurt to being a rain jacket (those from Alabama and Texas, you can bring an umbrella.. but we will laugh at you).
