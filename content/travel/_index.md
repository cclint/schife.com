# Getting Here
Our ceremony and the whole wedding shindig will be at the Windy Point Campground in Dillon, Colorado. We booked the entire campground, so there is lots of available parking. We know that many of you will be flying in - once we get closer and everyone knows where they are staying, we can set up a carpool to get folks without cars to the site. Alternatively, Uber and Lyft are both active in the area and rides can be booked through their apps.
