## iEat
Oh my, this little project still has so much potential. iEat was my very first personal project outside of class. My mother and I could never decide on where to eat, so I figured I would put my new programming skills to work. The goal of this program was to automate this decision, or at least give an interesting suggestion. I plan to expand on [iEat](https://github.com/cclint/Python-Projects) in the near future, as my programming skills have increased significantly in the past two years. There are so many different directions this project could go.

## My First Ray Tracer
During my second semester as a computer science student at UAB, I became acquainted with my objected oriented programming professor, Dr. Byrd. One weekend (right before finals..), I called him asking if he would be interested in coding up a ray tracer with me. That same Saturday afternoon.. 9 hours later.. we built [my first raytracer](https://github.com/cclint/first-raytracer) in Racket!

## Conway's Game of Life in C
In my objected oriented programming class, we had honors meetings once per week, where we would talk about various topics like functional programming, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and so much more. That being said, our last lab was dedicated to the passing of John Horton Conway, who was a famous mathematician and computer scientist. In his memory, we implemented [Conway's Game of Life](https://github.com/cclint/AdvanceLabClub).

## Galactic Empire Employee Management Web App
During my internship at UAB Research Computing, I was given the task to build a [CRUD web app](https://github.com/cclint/Research-Computing) with python and Flask. Naturally, I found a [tutorial](https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-crud-web-app-with-python-and-flask-part-two)
 to help guide me through this process and familiarize myself with Flask and CRUD web apps. Since this was a mere exercise to get myself familiar with web development, I decided to theme this web app as if it were to be used by the Galactic Empire. May the force be with you and enjoy!
